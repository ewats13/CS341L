#CACHE LAB

This assignment required us to write a Cache Simulator from scratch (csim.c) along with a matrix transpose function (trans.c) that is optimized for cache performance.
The overview and requirements of this assignment are specified in the PDF "CacheLab_INFO"

************************
Running the autograders:
************************

Before running the autograders, compile your code:
linux> make

Check the correctness of your simulator:
    linux> ./test-csim

Check the correctness and performance of your transpose functions:
    linux> ./test-trans -M 32 -N 32
    linux> ./test-trans -M 64 -N 64
    linux> ./test-trans -M 61 -N 67

Check everything at once (this is the program that the instructor ran while grading):
    linux> ./driver.py
